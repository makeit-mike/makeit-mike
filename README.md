Willkommen! 

My Name is Michael, and this is my GitHub for MakeIt-Mike.
Contact: mike.isaac.jones@gmail.com
I am U.S. based, play guitar in a small-town-good-for-nothing band, and speak a little German (not sure how that helps immediately in the open source world...)

In terms of skill, I would rank myself as follows (In order of strongest to weakest):
  1. C#, SQL, .NET
  2. JS, HTML, CSS, SCSS
  3. Swift
  4. Java
  5. C++
  6. Python
  7. COBOL
  8. Everything else
  9. Excel (yes, I am better at EVERYTHING ELSE moreso than I am competent in Excel)
  10. //Honestly I just thought having 10 items would look professional, perhaps I should have thought this through. 
    
I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics, minor in Computer Science. 

I am only 1/2 classes short on finishing out the major to CompSci, 
but when the company that I interned for offered me a full time Full-Stack Developer postition, I quickly shifted my priorities.
I would much rather spend 8 hours coding actual things that help people, than spend all night trying to invert a binary tree in FORTRAN or worse... reading a text book instead of formal documentation.

I spend most of my professional time in .NET Core, .NET Framework, T-SQL (mostly 2016), and primarily well versed in all things Azure.
However, my hobbies, as far as coding, are currently React.JS (SPA's, Web Dev, JS Framework), SFML/C++ (Game Dev, Algorith practice), and Swift (iOS, Mobile Dev)
