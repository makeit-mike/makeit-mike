Hello there, my name is Michael, and this is my GitHub for MakeIt-Mike.
Like my short bio, I can most simply be generalized as a person who loves playing guitar, coding, and sitting back at the end of the day with a nice cigar and a good IPA. Not entirely unique, but 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'.

In terms of skill, I would rank myself as follows (In order of strongest to weakest):
  1. C#, SQL (from legacy to bleeding edge. I have worked in VB.NET projects and DOTNET 6.0.. Everything from WPF to Blazor)
  2. JS, HTML, CSS, SCSS (Web Development)
  3. C++ (Algorithms, OpenGL, Maths, SFML)
  5. Swift (Apple Development)
  6. Haskell (maths and minor personal work in XMonad)
  7. Python (maths and Flask RESTful APIs)
  8. COBOL
  9. Everything else
  10. Excel (yes, I am better at EVERYTHING ELSE moreso than I am competent in Excel)
  11. //Honestly I just thought having 10 items would look professional, perhaps I should have thought this through. 
    
I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics, minor in Computer Science. 

I spend most of my professional time in .NET Core, .NET Framework, T-SQL, and primarily well versed in all things Azure.
I preffer macOS and archLinux, but I am very familiar with Active Directory and Windows File Management from a coding perspective.
