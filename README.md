Hello there, my name is Michael but I also go by Mike. I like to code.

My favourite languages are C#, Haskell, and C++. However, recently I have been enjoying Rust and Swift.

By trade I am a dotnet full stack developer, primarily working in dotnetcore, but also maintain many full .Net Framework applications. 

I absolutely love C#, but do not like being tied down to windows by nature of design. So I try and branch out whenever possible.

I am also very familiar with HTML, CSS, JS/TS, SQL.
Moderately familiar with Python, Java, and PostgreSQL.

As for frameworks, I am familiar with ASP.NET (Framework,Core,MVC), Blazor, React, SwiftUI, JQuery..

I am pretty okay with GitHub, but most of the time I use Azure DevOps professionally to manage my work projects.
